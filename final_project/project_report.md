## R1 Proposal (proposal)

### R1.1 Application problem description
 
Complete? (Yes) 

The project involves implementing the iconic DVD Logo Challenge, where the player controls the direction of a bouncing logo to make it hit the screen's corners for points. The primary goal is to combine animation, user interaction, and graphics techniques to create a nostalgic yet engaging experience.

### R1.6 Writing of the proposal
 
Complete? (Yes) 

see proposal



## R2 Design & implementation (programming)

### R2.1 Problem solving and algorithms
 
Complete? (Yes) 

Collision detection is implemented to detect wall and corner hits. The logo's trajectory and velocity are adjusted based on these collisions, and colors change dynamically.
